<dl><dt>Introduction</dt><dd>
<p>
<a href="http://www.seagullproject.org/">Seagull</a> is a mature OOP framework for building web, command line and GUI applications.  Licensed under <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">BSD</a>, the project allows <a href="http://php.net/">PHP</a> developers to easily integrate and manage code resources, and build complex applications quickly.
</p>
<p>
Many popular <a href="http://php.net/">PHP</a> applications are already seamlessly <a href="http://trac.seagullproject.org/wiki/Integration" class="wiki">integrated</a>
within the project, as are various templating engines, testing tools
and managed library code. If you&#39;re a beginner, the framework provides
a number of <a href="http://trac.seagullproject.org/wiki/Modules" class="wiki">sample applications</a> that can be customised and extended to suit your needs. If you&#39;re an
intermediate or advanced developer, take advantage of Seagull&#39;s <a href="http://trac.seagullproject.org/wiki/Standards/SoftwareBestPractices"><span class="wiki">best practices</span></a> , <a href="http://trac.seagullproject.org/wiki/Standards" class="wiki">standards</a> and <a href="http://trac.seagullproject.org/browser/trunk/lib/SGL" class="source">modular codebase</a> to build your applications in record time.
</p>
<p>
Once your development cycle is complete, use Seagull&#39;s features for
deploying and maintaining your apps locally and remotely. Check out the
friendly and active <a href="http://trac.seagullproject.org/wiki/Community" class="wiki">Seagull community</a> and see if Seagull&#39;s a good fit for you.
